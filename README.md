# LRRcomunityModPack

This is a ModPack made by and for the [Loading Ready Run](http://www.loadingreadyrun.com) community and hopefully to be played on Mine O'Clock.

To use, go to Export and there a zpi file, which has a curse profile (may not be the most up to data configs)

To discuss go to go to LRRs [Twich Account](https://www.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun) and from there you can use the !discord command in chat to get the link to the discord.
